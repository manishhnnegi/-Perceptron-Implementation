In this article we will understand the Perceptron and its limitations. We will also implement logic gates using perceptron.
The Perceptron is one of the simplest ANN (Artificial Neural Network) architectures. It is based on a artificial neuron called as a threshold logic unit (TLU), or sometimes a linear threshold unit (LTU).
